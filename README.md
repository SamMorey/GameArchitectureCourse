# Game Architecture course

This project contains code I wrote from a course taught by Jason Weimann. Mainly intended to be used as a reference for my own progress. Please note that this project does not contain the rest of the assets from the course, but if you would like to use the code for something feel free.

## Instillation instructions

1. Install Unity 2021 or a newer version:
   - I recommend using Unity hub for this: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download
2. Clone the repo into ProjectFolder/Assets/Scripts/
